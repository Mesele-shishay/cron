## API Endpoints

### Health Checks

```bash
GET /api/health
# Basic health check

GET /api/health/detailed
# Detailed health information
```

### Manual Operations

```bash
POST /api/health/trigger
# Manually trigger finalization
# Headers: Content-Type: application/json
```

## Usage Examples

### Check Service Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/api/health
```

### Manual Trigger

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/health/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### View Logs

```bash
# The service logs all API calls with timestamps
# Look for lines like:
# ‚úÖ [2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z] Finalization successful (1250ms)
# üèÜ Winner: user123 (Score: 5)
```

## Integration

This service integrates with your main INNO application by calling:

```http
POST /api/game/finalize
Headers:
  x-cron-secret: your-secret
  Content-Type: application/json
```

Make sure your main application has the `CRON_SECRET` environment variable set to the same value.

## Docker Deployment

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  cron-service:
    build: .
    environment:
      - INNO_API_URL=http://your-inno-app:3000
      - CRON_SECRET=your-secure-secret
    ports:
      - "3002:3002"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Monitoring

The service provides detailed logging:

- ‚úÖ **Successful finalizations** with winner information
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Failed attempts** with error details
- üîÑ **API call timing** and performance metrics
- üö® **Connection issues** and network errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**

   - Ensure your main INNO application is running
   - Check `INNO_API_URL` is correct

2. **Authentication Failed**

   - Verify `CRON_SECRET` matches your main app
   - Check main app has `CRON_SECRET` environment variable

3. **Timeout Errors**
   - The service has a 30-second timeout
   - Check network connectivity between services

### Logs

All activities are logged to the console. In production, consider:

- Using a log aggregation service (e.g., Winston with file transport)
- Setting up log rotation
- Monitoring log files for errors

## Development

### Available Scripts
